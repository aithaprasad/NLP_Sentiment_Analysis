Sentimental Analysis for Welsh language with "Anything goes" approach

This challenge involves sentiment analysis of tweets written in the Welsh language (Links to an external site.). In the absence of a gold-standard training corpus for Welsh, I've used the presence or absence of “happy” and “sad” emoji/emoticons as a proxy for sentiment. For example:

“Happy”: 😃, 😄, 😅, 😍, :)
“Sad”: 😞, 😟, 😡, :(
We then define a tweet to have positive sentiment if it contains at least one happy emoji/emoticon, and no sad emoji/emoticon, and we define negative sentiment analogously.
